Question 4: Write a short note on tag and
element with an example?
Answer 4: HTML TAG :HTML tags are the
keywords on a web page that define how your
web browser must format and display your web
page.
There are a total of 100 HTML tags. We will
divide them into categories and discuss the
important ones in this article.
Head Tag
The head tag <head> contains all the elements describing the
document.
Title Tag
The title tag <title> specifies the HTML page title, which is shown in
the browser’s title bar.
Body Tag
The body tag <body> is where you insert your web page’s content.
Paragraph Tag
A paragraph tag <p> is used to define a paragraph on a web page.
Heading Tag

The HTML heading tag is used to define the heading of the HTML
document. The <h1> tag defines the most important tag, and <h6>
defines the least.
For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing
tag.
HTML ELEMENT : An HTML element is defined by a start tag,
some content, and an end tag.
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
In HTML, an element is a section of an HTML document. Some
HTML elements represent visible components on a web page,
such as text, images, or buttons, while others denote different
sections of the page or provide meta-information about the
document.
There are three kinds of HTML elements: normal elements, raw
text elements, and void elements.
Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
